# Chase-Bank-account-activity-analysis

Reads a Chase Bank account activity csv file, cleans and formats the data and plots charts for personal financial analysis.

At the beginning of 2020 I had just graduated in Industrial Engineering and moved to the United States to get back together with my wife. As I was not allowed to work until granted the green card I decided to spend the time in between studying to enhance my chances of getting a job in analytics when allowed to. Because our finances were tight and I had been managing it using an Excel spreadsheet I decided that my first data analytics project would be to automate that process. I believe this might be useful to someone who has a Chase bank account and would like to plot some charts to check on their finances. Hope you enjoy it!
